Brief Project description (1 paragraph summary) [Put this in your repo's README also]
We want to recreate Fireboy and Watergirl in Processing. The original Fireboy and Watergirl game involves two players working together to escape a room. In our version, Fireboy and Watergirl will be different objects that move using WASD and arrow keys, respectively. Each character will be programmed under a Character class, which has a jump feature and a die feature. We will have puzzles and platforms as well as pools of lava/water that can kill either one/both, a “death” screen, and a “level completed” screen. With extra time, this puzzle aspect will include levers and buttons that open doors and with time, it will have easy, medium, and hard levels. Additionally, we could create add-ons like power ups and different additions to the puzzles like push-able boxes.

Expanded Description:
Critical features (Minimum Viable Product) - What do you want to have after a week?
One level
WASD, arrow keys moving
Fireboy and Watergirl designed
Doors to end a level
Platforms
Nice to have features - What would you want to have after 2 weeks(the end)?
Pools of lava/water
Buttons/levers
timer
Walking and jumping animations

Outline of how you intend to design your project and how methods/classes will fit together
Background methods
Level background
“YOU DIED” screen
LEVEL FINISHED Screen
Fireboy and watergirl are different objects
jump feature w/ cooldown, you have to land before jumping again
death
moving w/ key press
Acceleration w time
gravity
Platforms are also separate objects that Fireboy and Watergirl will detect for (will stop downwards movement unless jumping) + moving platforms
Pools of Water + Lava are objects that don't have collision but they kill
Levers + buttons will be objects but move when touched by a character reaches a certain point

UML Diagram of your design. This can be handwritten, but there are so many nice UML tools. (depending on the style of project you may have more diagram and less outline or vice versa)

Development Phases/Stages
Think "proof of concept" , "minimum viable project", "final goal" as the three main phases.
Each phase should have multiple bullet points and sub-points.
You can designate what you completed via checking off things in this document!
You can "cross out" removed ideas/features, but leave the original text in the document.
Proof of Concept
Character design and movement
Each character looking to the side
Make characters move across the floor
Gravity
Make characters jump (not affected by holding down a key)
Platforms
Draw method that creates the rectangle
Method that acts as a barrier

Minimum Viable Project
Ending
Door method in obstacle class
LEVEL COMPLETED in pop-up class
Triggered by an in-game action
Final Goal
Better graphics
More detailed background
More detailed door design
Walking and jumping animations
Pools of water/lava
Pools method in obstacle class
Death
YOU DIED in pop-up class
Animate pop-ups in game

Optionally images can be included to help indicate your intentions
