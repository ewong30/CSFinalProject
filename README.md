## Brief Project description
We want to recreate Fireboy and Watergirl in Processing. The original Fireboy and Watergirl game involves two players working together to escape a room. In our version, Fireboy and Watergirl will be different objects that move using WASD and arrow keys, respectively.
Each character will be programmed under a Character class, which has a jump feature and a die feature. We will have puzzles and platforms as well as pools of lava/water that can kill either one/both, a “death” screen, and a “level completed” screen.
With extra time, this puzzle aspect will include levers and buttons that open doors and with time, it will have easy, medium, and hard levels. Additionally, we could create add-ons like power ups and different additions to the puzzles like push-able boxes.

The Prototype Google Document is linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11r0vwaMjeIKi1Fcn6KsxP72kj12YtNphz2ERwZSUVpM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Compile/Run Instructions
1. Clone the repository into a directory.
2. Download Processing Sound library.
3. Open the Game directory in Processing.
4. Click run in the top left corner of the Processing window.

| 5/24/22 | | I practiced more merging and branching. |
| 5/25/22 | I designed the background for the game in Processing. |  |
| 5/26/22 | I created a basic design for Fireboy. | I created basic move functions for the characters. |
| 5/27/22 | I changed the background from Processing into a picture. | I fixed merge conflicts. |
| 5/29/22 | I changed the character designs to more basic shapes and created a jump/up function. |  |
