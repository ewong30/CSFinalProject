Brief Project description (1 paragraph summary).
We want to recreate Fireboy and Watergirl in Processing. The original Fireboy and Watergirl game involves two players working together to escape a room. In our version, Fireboy and Watergirl will be different objects that move using WASD and arrow keys, respectively. 
Each character will be programmed under a Character class, which has a jump feature and a die feature. We will have puzzles and platforms as well as pools of lava/water that can kill either one/both, a “death” screen, and a “level completed” screen. 
With extra time, this puzzle aspect will include levers and buttons that open doors and with time, it will have easy, medium, and hard levels. Additionally, we could create add-ons like power ups and different additions to the puzzles like push-able boxes.
